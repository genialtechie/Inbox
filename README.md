A simple Decentralized app built using Solidity, Javascript, jquery, html & bootstrap.
It runs on a local Ganache blockchain
It operates by using the web3 instance injected by MetaMask into the browser and web3js methods to interact with a simple smart contract deployed to the local ganache blockchain.
This is made easy and possible by the truffle suite
Check it out, feel free to suggest any corrections as I will be updating as I learn more in my blockchain development journey.
