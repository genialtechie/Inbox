A simple Decentralized app built using Solidity, Javascript, jquery, html & bootstrap.
It runs on a local Ganache blockchain
It operates by using the web3 instance injected by MetaMask into the browser and web3js methods to interact with a simple smart contract deployed to the local ganache blockchain.
This is made easy and possible by the truffle suite
Check it out, feel free to suggest any corrections.

# Requirements
* You need to have Truffle, Ganache & Visual Studio installed.
* You also need to have MetaMask installed and connected to your local ganache blockchain. [Check out this tutorial](https://trufflesuite.com/docs/truffle/getting-started/truffle-with-metamask.html/ "Named link title")

# Usage
* Clone the repository.
* In the node console, run `npm install` to install dependencies. 
* Run `truffle migrate`, then `npm run dev`.
* Open browser, connect one of your ganache wallets via MetaMask and interact with the contract
